# Portfolio Optimization with Real-Time Insights

This project combines classical portfolio optimization with real-time simulation and live news-based analysis. It models realistic investing behavior: construct a portfolio using historical data, simulate post-investment performance, and stay updated with relevant market-moving news.


## What This Project Does

- Uses historical stock data to optimize portfolio weights based on:
  - Sharpe ratio
  - Minimum variance
  - Target return
  - Risk parity
- Tracks portfolio value after a user-defined investment date
- Visualizes asset-level contributions and benchmark comparisons
- Pulls recent news headlines for each stock to contextualize performance
- Saves charts and logs automatically to the `plots/` folder
